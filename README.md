School Web App Development Task

Purpose: Allow viewing of past messages on an online platform.

Plan: Make site to view past messages first, then make non functional requirements such as gacha, javascript and then sendinng messages


| Functional Requirement | Reasoning |
| Sign In Page with User IDs | Allows the same account to send multiple messages |
| Connect Backend allowing the display of messages | Allows messages to be viewed |
| 3 pages total | Allows the entire site to be linked together through links |


| Nonfunctional Requirements | Reasoning |
| Potential Gacha/Cosmetic/Gambling system | Allows detailed customisation for the accounts |
| Notification / Javascript popup system | Allows new messages to be viewed in real time |
| Beautiful formatting | Ease on eyes|
| Audio recordings being sent | Greater file type upload accessability |


Design Choices:

Simple colour scheme:

A simple colour scheme was to be used, too many complicated colours would increase difficulty in the creation of the website and also potentially make it much more difficult to look at with eyes.

Colour Choice:

4 shades of navy, 3 highlight colours (cyan, blueish gray and cream white)

Font IS ANITO

Timeframe above profile picture in 24 hour time

Date not required to be recorded but would be better if recorded


| Thing | reason |
|Dark Colour Scheme|Good for eyes, accent colours will stand out easier|
|No navigation|Website isnt large enough for dedicated navigation|
|Anito as font|Lucas doesnt like nunito sans so I chose Anito and he likes it|
|Background image for desktop design|Simple to make (hopefully) and also aesthetically pleasing|
|Gacha button on home page|Easy access to user|
