School Web App Development Task

Purpose: Allow viewing of past messages on an online platform.

Plan: Make site to view past messages first, then make non functional requirements such as gacha, javascript and then sendinng messages


| Functional Requirement | Reasoning |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Sign In Page with User IDs | Allows the same account to send multiple messages |
| Connect Backend allowing the display of messages | Allows messages to be viewed |
| 3 pages total | Allows the entire site to be linked together through links |


| Nonfunctional Requirements | Reasoning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Potential Gacha/Cosmetic/Gambling system | Allows detailed customisation for the accounts |
| Notification / Javascript popup system | Allows new messages to be viewed in real time |
| Beautiful formatting | Ease on eyes|
| Audio recordings being sent | Greater file type upload accessability |


**Design Choices:**

*Simple colour scheme:*

A simple colour scheme was to be used, too many complicated colours would increase difficulty in the creation of the website and also potentially make it much more difficult to look at with eyes.

*Colour Choice:*

4 shades of navy, 3 highlight colours (cyan, blueish gray and cream white)

These colours were picked, mainly because Dark Navy is an adequate replacement for black and is softer on eyes. Most borders would be made with a blueish gray outline, which is easy to look at and still distinguishable.

Cyan would be rareley used, and only really used as borders/outlines on important things like the sign out button.

Cream White is going to be the text colour of the messages.

*Font Choice:*

Font IS ANITO. Chosen by Lucas Chen

*Message Display notes:*

Time when the message sent should be displayed. The date on which it was sent should be displayed too!

*Icon Notes*

Icons should be simple and understandable. I will choose extremely simple icons and extremely easy understandable icons.


| Other Design Choices | Reasoning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dark Colour Scheme | Allows colours like grey to be used as accent colours, instead of really bright colours |
| No Dedicated Navigation | Website isnt large enough for dedicated navigation |
| Background image for desktop design |Simple to make (hopefully) and also aesthetically pleasing|
